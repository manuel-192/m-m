# great-mirrors
Program **great-mirrors** creates a list of mirrors based on given criteria.
It aims to provide the best list of mirrors, and shows detailed information
about the mirror statistics, such as the age (how "old" files are) and a file fetch time.

By default great-mirrors optimizes the mirrorlist by the age of the latest sync of mirrors.
This attribute is often the most useful in order to use the most up-to-date
mirrors.

Note: only https mirrors are ranked.
